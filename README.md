# Numeric-Genetic-Algorithm
A genetic algorithm that evolves towards a target number
# Numeric-Genetic-AlgorithmA genetic algorithm that evolves towards a target number
To be used in conjunction with the project PyVlov's Dog

# Upcoming
Integration between the two projects has not yet been complete, so that is inbound
The Genetic-Algorithm has not yet been given error handling 
# Instructions
Running the file "graphing" will call the Genetic-Algorithm and graph out its best and average fitness per generation
